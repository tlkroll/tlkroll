<h2>Hi, I'm Tom. I am a recent computer science graduate with a passion for cybersecurity.</h2>
While studying for my earlier Information Technology degree, the most fun I had in school was completing security labs involving password cracking, MITM, SQL injection, etc. After completing that degree, I studied computer science because I wanted to understand computing at its most basic levels before returning to security. Now that I am finished with my computer science degree, I look forward to studying for a master's in cybersecurity at Georgia Tech starting in January of 2025. I am eager to learn more about low level security topics such as binary exploitation, malware analysis, and reverse engineering and cannot wait to get started working in the field!
